Student Built. Requests for changes and updates will be viewed, but updated as needed by designer.
This OOT is designed to populate wideband spectrum for algorithmic tests (see app dir). The populated signals are random and only take on the PHY layer properties of a signal. Gates are available to stochastically given timing properties to the signals.
